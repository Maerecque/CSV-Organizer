# CSV Organizer
This repo is part of bigger personal project i'm doing, but I thought some people might find this useful.

# Functionality
Basically all this code does is help me create hashes for images I have saved in a csv file. If I ever happen to rename a file or a file is deleted this script should keep the csv file organized for me.

# Requirements
To my knowledge works this code with the base libraries of Python 3.11 and it doesn't whop whop too bad.
